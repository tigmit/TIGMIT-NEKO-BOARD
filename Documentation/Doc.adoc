# TIGMIT NEKO BOARD 

This is a one man project trying to create (my) ultimate keyboard. taylored to the personal needs of a software developer with a thing for cute and weeby shit... hence the name :P 


image::../PNGs/tigmit Neco board.png[]

the board features 

- 79 keys in a kind of.. compact TKL arrangement.
- a 240 x 240 round Display
- rotary encoder
- analog slider
- fully controllable RGB for each key
- hot swappable 
- the key-plate rests on foam pads to ensure a smoooth typing experience


it's a wireless board using bluetooth to connect to your devices :3

## The brain of the operation

is a esp32 vroom devkit. for now at least. perhaps i will change the controller at some point or integrate it onto the PCB.

anyways it can be accessed for programming via a lid in the bottom of the case as seen here:

it has a fixed angle between 4 and 5 degrees but supprts feet to change the angle to any requred needs really :3

to power the thing it uses a 8000mAh lipo battery with a breakout pcb that handles all of the power tasks like lipo protection and stepping up the battery voltage to 5V for the RGB LEDs

speaking of LEDs. the board has 79 adressable RGB LEDs. more specific SK6812MINI-E (datasheet in Documents/miscFiles Folder)

## KEY Matrix

the keys are arranged as a 6 x 15 Keymatrix. but wait. that uses a total of 21 I/O PINS?! how can we still controll a Display, a slider, and a Rotary encoder with pins to spare?????? well simple hehe the board has TWO 8 bit shift registers wich are controlled via SPI for maximum speeeed. gotta go fast kid.

this way its possible to save a massive ammount of pins. reducing the total ammount needed from 21 to basicllay just 8 pins for the whole keymatrix :P 

NOTE: its still very possible to reach a nice 1kHz polling rate for each key so there is no noticable lag when typing because we are utalizing SPI to controll the Shift registers :3

BUT! another trick is needed to pull all of this off with just one ESP32...

### Multicore processing

the esp32 features a delicios dual core MCU which we can use to our advantage hehe

Core 0 runs ONLY the key matrix polling and has priority over all the other tasks. to make absolutely sure that the keyboard... well... TYPES!

Core 1 handles all the other tasks like refreshing the display and running the Display Statemachine with alongside RGB tasks and sooo on. at the expense of a slightly slower refresh rate of the display. but its still fast enough for a nice experience :3 and the display has a buffer itself which eliminates the need to refresh it constantly all together ;P so we only need to update it in when we have to

# USING GC9A01 round TFT Display:

## setup:

### TFT_eSPI Lib

to use the GC9A01 Display, i am using the TFT_eSPI Lib by Bodmer'
https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI
it requires some work to set it up for our particular Display.
thats why the TFT_eSPI was moved to the local libs folder in order to make it easyer to clone the repo.

if it does get lost then following changes need to be made in lib\TFT_eSPI\User_Setup.h:

 - select the right Driver. In Line 69 LOL ROFL (/* _ *)/  use #define GC9A01_DRIVER

 - set the requred Pin defines for the Display:

 - you can simply delete everything in the user_setup file and replace it with this setup:

[source,c++]

connect these pins as per the defines and you should be good to go.

# NEKO SHELL

The project features a fully functional live console/Shell to debug and play around.

find more info on how to create your own commands inside ```NekoShell.hpp```

To enable the NEKO SHELL go to debugSettings.hpp and enable ```#define DEVMODE```
