# USING GC9A01 round TFT Display:

## setup:

### TFT_eSPI Lib

to use the GC9A01 Display, i am using the TFT_eSPI Lib by Bodmer'
https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI
it is included locally in this project because it requires some work to set it up for our particular Display.

to use the Display we need to change some Settings in lib\TFT_eSPI\User_Setup.h

Following changes need to be made:

 - select the right Driver. In Line 69 (LOL ROFL (/*_*)/ ) use #define GC9A01_DRIVER

 - set the requred Pin defines for the Display:

[source,c++]
----
    #define TFT_MOSI 23 // Aka. SDA     (must be MOSI on your board)
    #define TFT_SCLK 18 // Aka. SCL     (must be SCLK on your board)
    #define TFT_CS 22   // Chip select  (Usr defined)
    #define TFT_DC 16   // Data Command (Usr defined)
    #define TFT_RST 4   // Reset pin    (Usr defined)
----

connect these pins as per the defines and you should be good to go.
